# EthCrop
This appication is built mainly for Indian farmers,who face problems in getting the right price for their crops because of the intervention of middleman (mainly moneylenders and big storage agencies). They buy the crops at very low price from the farmers and sell it at a higher price to customers or endusers. Thus this creates a big problem for the farmers and thus not brings any security in transactions. There comes the use of modern technology Blockchain which contains the history of transactions between users and it also can not be altered. It even eliminates the third party intervention and thus produces the best of the results for both farmers and end users.

# Work Model
The working model is basically a cycle in which the farmers take money from the end users which is a sort of investment from their side. The farmers quote some crops production and the variety they produce. All this total production is then converted to different ratios based on the end user's shares and they are given tokens for that. Thus the token over here is the cryptographic currency generated in Blockchain. They can use these tokens to get their vegetables or crops from farmers.

This model is thus a kind of Smart Contract between users and farmers.

# Advantages
This model eliminates lots of problems of farmers and end users - 
1) It removes the burdens of farmers because of moneylenders and their high interest charges.
2) It also gives them surity about the money and production over their land.
3) It also ensures money flow within the model and thus new users who invest more get more benefit and thus this flow increases more users to invest in the system and it grows with the communtiy.
4) It gives the people an extra edge who invest in this system about surity of good quality of crops which can be stored over in blockchain by the IOT over in soil. Thus users get assured of eating good food.
5) The users also have to pay less as compared to the middleman who charges more for the crops.
